# Predictive-model-to-forecast-demand-for-a-pharmaceutical-company-s-products
Description:

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating demand in a pharmaceutical company, taking into account elements such as previous sales data, external effects, and time series analysis. By incorporating the model into decision-making processes, pharmaceutical organizations may optimize inventory management, production planning, and distribution, resulting in increased efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Keywords: Demand forecasting, pharmaceutical industry, machine learning, time series analysis, Decision Tree, ARIMA, SARIMA

Potential users: Pharmaceutical companies, supply chain managers, demand planners, business analysts, researchers

Contributions:

A predictive model for forecasting demand in a pharmaceutical company
A comparison of different forecasting algorithms for pharmaceutical product demand
A demonstration of the importance of choosing appropriate algorithms and ongoing model improvement
Future development:

Incorporate additional features into the model, such as marketing campaigns, product attributes, and economic indicators
Investigate the use of deep learning algorithms for demand forecasting
Develop a user-friendly interface for the model to make it accessible to a wider range of users
Steps to use:

Clone the repo to your local machine
Install the required dependencies
Run the following command to train the model:
python train_model.py
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by running the following command:
python predict.py
